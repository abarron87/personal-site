<p>Since my last post I have moved to France for a new challenge. I spent my first month in Paris staying with a very good friend of mine and I wanted to write about my experience.</p>

<p>In this past month I have been reunited with friends, explored a new city, attended an intensive language class, and perhaps most importantly: eaten a lot of great bread.</p>

<h2>The architecture</h2>

<p>The first thing that struck me about Paris - apart from the crazy cycle lanes that are more part of the pavement than the road - is the fact that almost everywhere you look there is classy architecture on show. Coming from a bigger city (London) I have a different view of Paris than others. I don’t think it’s too big, as others do. I like its size, and most things seem to be accessible in 30 minutes or less on the Metro.</p>

<p>Whether it’s the Sacre-Coeur, the Gare du Nord, Gare de l’Est, Notre-Dame, the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower, Paris has fantastic style in abundance. These are just the start.</p>

<p>You can turn down any side street and even the apartment buildings are beautiful, most of them with an array of plants decorating the exterior. The streets aren’t the cleanest, as was pointed out to me, but most of the time I was looking up at another building. Granted, I was lucky with the weather. On my first trip to Paris a couple of years ago I wasn’t so taken with the city, and it’s no coincidence that it rained the whole time. The lack of modern development in central Paris is a tourist’s dream.</p>

<p>Just outside the city, about 40 minutes on the train from Gare de Lyon is <a href="http://www.musee-chateau-fontainebleau.fr/" target="_blank">Fontainebleau</a>. It is a big stately home, now open to the public and was home to many Popes and Kings and Emperors. It’s a grand building, and one that I preferred from the outside. Oh and there’s pony rides that go around the estate for those that are in to that kind of thing.</p>

<h2>The language</h2>
<p>My main priority when coming to France was and still is to learn the language. Over the past year I have been slowly learning it again (I “learned” it in school but I’m not sure much of it stuck) but not really practicing by speaking.</p>

<p>I knew it would be hard, and I’m my own worst critic, but I wasn’t prepared for how tough it would be. Hearing and understanding being the hardest. My good friend Kirsty came up with a stunner of one line advice: <strong>”the sooner you get over the embarrassment of speaking, the better”</strong>. Easier said than done, but she was right. It’s getting easier every day and I’m definitely noticing the progress. Often I still go most of the day without speaking French but sentences are always swirling around in my head. Going to language exchanges (check out <a href="http://www.franglish.eu" target="_blank">Franglish</a> has no doubt helped because I was regularly repeating the same things. Throw in a couple of compliments from french natives and BOOM: confidence slaps you in the face!</p>

<p>It’s important to note your progress every step of the way both to remind yourself how awesome you are and how far you’ve come since the beginning/last milestone. Remember the days when you got something new into a conversation for the first time and it wasn’t met with a look of confusion. A couple of weeks ago I used “autant que” (English: as much as) and it was met with an impressed look. But I’ll settle for normal any day.</p>

<p>I attended a school (<a href="http://www.accord-langues.com/" target="_blank">Accord</a>) for 3 weeks and didn’t know what to expect. I threw myself in the deep-end and opted for 9-5 every day. A decision I realised was a mistake after the first couple of days. My reading and writing level are higher than my speaking and listening, and as the school runs all year and new students start all the time it was difficult at first. For others thinking of doing this I would say it is of course beneficial but trust yourself to know what you want to focus on. I decided after the first week to only go to morning classes so that in the afternoons I could practice what I had learnt.</p>

<h2>The food</h2>

<p>It’s early days and I’m a stickler for the crappy food I love. Thankfully, France seems to be the capital for ham and cheese sandwiches. I’m in heaven! (Metaphorically speaking though. There isn’t this much dog turd in heaven, I hope.)</p>

<p>Croq Monsieurs, baguettes, escargots, and galettes are just some of what I’ve tried so far.</p>

<p>As far as sweet things go, we have most of them at home. They are just better though. Mmmm, pain aux raisins.</p>

<p>I now feel like I have to hide the fact that I am buying cheddar or Boursin. Crimes against cheese!</p>

<p>Here’s to more opportunity to try more cheese and wine over the coming months. Santé!</p>

<h2>The people</h2>

<p>Not all French people are rude! Erase that stereotype from your mind right now. Parisians are just city people.</p>
<p>Everyone was friendly to me. Even the people who don’t make space for you to pass in the street. I’m sure their feeling of self-importance is well-earned…</p>

<p>It’s known that when the French have an established circle of friends it’s harder to break into it as an outsider. Perhaps this is where they got the tag of being a bit cold or rude. Everyone I met was lovely and tried to make me feel at ease.</p>

<h2>Special thanks</h2>

<p>Special thanks to Kirsty for welcoming me into her home, including me in her activities (except boot camp. I hate you for that ;)), and introducing me to her friends. It made the whole month a lot more fun.</p>

<p>I’ll be back!</p>
