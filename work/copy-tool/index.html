<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
    <li>It leverages the awesomeness of the two-way-data-binding and filtering (among other features) of Angular to update all visible banners with text changes on the fly.</li>
    <li>Both plain text and HTML can be entered, and the container &lt;h3&gt; element can be overridden from a simple drop down.</li>
    <li>There are 2 input options:
        <ul>
            <li>One for long copy which will go on the larger banners.</li>
            <li>One for short copy.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The final code can then be taken by clicking "Grab" by individual banners or the "Grab all" button at the top.</li>
</ul>
